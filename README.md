# Flower Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the species of flowers based on their physical measurements. The **Iris dataset** is used, which includes three flower species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The dataset contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can predict the species of a flower based on the input features (sepal and petal measurements). Several machine learning algorithms are applied and compared to identify the best performing model.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale features.
- **Model Building:** Train various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Once trained, the model predicts the species of a flower when given its features.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or the Python scripts to explore and execute the project.

## Results:
The machine learning model is able to predict the correct species of a flower with high accuracy based on its sepal and petal dimensions. The project includes the full code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
